Penguins vs Aliens
==================

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

When Alice and Bob the two penguins were married, the priest gave them the ring of love and said: "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this!"

Little did they know that they were destined to be heroes... Until the aliens came and attacked Earth.

You can move them with the Arrow keys or WASD, and change the distance between them with JK.

And don't forget: love trumps aliens!
